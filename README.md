# Angular + Spring Boot CI/CD Project

This project is a web application built with **Angular** (frontend) and **Spring Boot** (backend). It is designed with a CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, featuring automated builds, unit tests, and code quality checks via **SonarQube**. The pipeline includes artifact management with **Nexus** and containerization using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. Monitoring and observability are set up with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to ensure performance and reliability.
